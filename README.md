# SEVIS_Student_data
A variety of files to connect Excel spreadsheet data about students for SEVIS reporting compliance. 

These files allow international student advisors to build data on students via the openpyxl module in Python.

The purpose of this project was to automate populating certain data required by advisors for tracking students. Data reporting
from ISSM/fsaAtlas did not meet the needs of our office, so I built this application to improve data management efficiency.

Originally, my process was to copy and paste data from various profiles into a spreadsheet. This is now automated in Python.

Due to FERPA regulations, I cannot include the actual .xlsx files as they contain sensitive student data, however, please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to set up a similar process for automating data population in Excel with Python.
